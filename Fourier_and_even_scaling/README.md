# Fourier and even-scaling of CGR data involving more than 4 possible states (letters)
Important note: Unlike square CGR, use of symbolic python (SymPy) is essential for accuracy of the circular chaos game encoding method 
due to the use of irrational numbers. This is not used following Fourier transformation as techniques sensitive to small errors
are not used past that point. Please be aware of this change to float usage.
